# backtracking
This project demonstrates classic Backtracking algorithms — a powerful technique for solving recursive, constraint-based problems. Backtracking systematically explores all possible configurations and "backtracks" when a solution path fails, making it ideal for problems involving combinatorics, permutations, constraint satisfaction,.
# 🔁 Backtracking Algorithms

This project showcases a collection of classic **Backtracking** algorithms implemented to solve constraint-based recursive problems. Backtracking is a powerful technique used in problems where we build a solution incrementally and abandon a path when it is determined that it will not yield a valid result.

## 📌 What is Backtracking?

Backtracking is an algorithmic paradigm used to solve problems recursively by trying to build a solution step-by-step. Whenever the algorithm determines that a solution cannot be completed with the current path, it **backtracks** and tries a different path.

It is especially useful in:
- Decision-making problems
- Constraint satisfaction problems
- Combinatorial optimization
