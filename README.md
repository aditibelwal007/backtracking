# backtracking
This project demonstrates classic Backtracking algorithms â€” a powerful technique for solving recursive, constraint-based problems. Backtracking systematically explores all possible configurations and "backtracks" when a solution path fails, making it ideal for problems involving combinatorics, permutations, constraint satisfaction,.
